    About Me
  </h1>
  <div id="aboutme">
    <p>
      I am a digital designer, working mainly in Illustrator and Photoshop.
      I love designing things that give a sense of atmosphere and aesthetic,
      whether that be a 3D space to walk around in, a website or an illustration.

      I am currently teaching myself the basics of javascript and C#, with hopes
      of creating more interactive and fresh experiences.
